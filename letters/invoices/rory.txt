Attention:  Rory's Parents,

Re: Christmas Toy Invoice

Below are the charges for Rory's Christmas toy order. The cost for each toy is a percentage of your home's estimated value. The cost includes delivery fee, service fee and the North Pole transportation tax. HST is separate.

=================
Rory's Toy Order
=================
$2500 1 defective toy
----
$2500  Subtotal
$325   HST
====
$2825  Total


Your total comes to $2825. Payment is due upon receipt of invoice. Should you fail to submit prompt payment we will repossess all toys in this order by January 7.  I encourage you to imagine the tantrum that will ensue should all of Rory's toys suddenly disappear.

Due to a high number of NSF incidents we no longer accept personal cheques. Please make all payments through PayPal, Interac e-transfer or certified cheque.

Sincerely,

Guido the Elf,
Collections Department
Santa's Village


P.S. For a limited time get 25% off the best-seller by Ms. Claus, Iâ€™m Getting Nothing for Christmas: Raising Toy-Worthy Children in a Device-Driven World.
