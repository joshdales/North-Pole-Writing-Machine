Attention:  Alice's Parents,

Re: Christmas Toy Invoice

Below are the charges for Alice's Christmas toy order. The cost for each toy is a percentage of your home's estimated value. The cost includes delivery fee, service fee and the North Pole transportation tax. HST is separate.

Alice's Toy Order

$9998  Monopoly    
$9998  Batman    $0  Kaleidoscope (out of stock)
    
$9998  Skates    
$9998  Slinky    
$9998  Transformers  
----
$59988  Subtotal
$7787   HST
====
$67775  Total



Your total comes to $67775. Payment is due upon receipt of invoice. Should you fail to submit prompt payment we will repossess all toys in this order by January 7.  I encourage you to imagine the tantrum that will ensue should all of Alice's toys suddenly disappear.

Due to a high number of NSF incidents we no longer accept personal cheques. Please make all payments through PayPal, Interac e-transfer or certified cheque.

Sincerely,

Guido the Elf,
Collections Department
Santa's Village
