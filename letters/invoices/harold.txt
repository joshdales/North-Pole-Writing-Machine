Attention:  Harold's Parents,

Re: Christmas Toy Invoice

Below are the charges for Harold's Christmas toy order. The cost for each toy is a percentage of your home's estimated value. The cost includes delivery fee, service fee and the North Pole transportation tax. HST is separate.

$5990  Barbie    
$5990  Slinky    
$5990  Clue    
$5990  Plane    
$5990  Pony    
$5990  Risk

$35940  Subtotal
$4667   HST
====
$40607  Total



Your total comes to $40607. Payment is due upon receipt of invoice. Should you fail to submit prompt payment we will repossess all toys in this order by January 7.  I encourage you to imagine the tantrum that will ensue should all of Harold's toys suddenly disappear.

Due to a high number of NSF incidents we no longer accept personal cheques. Please make all payments through PayPal, Interac e-transfer or certified cheque.

Sincerely,

Guido the Elf,
Collections Department
Santa's Village
