Attention:  Gordie's Parents,

$4999  Bicycle

$4999  Lego

$419916  Total



Your total comes to $419916. Payment is due upon receipt of invoice. Should you fail to submit prompt payment we will repossess all toys in this order by January 7.  I encourage you to imagine the tantrum that will ensue should all of Gordie's toys suddenly disappear.

Due to a high number of NSF incidents we no longer accept personal cheques. Please make all payments through PayPal, Interac e-transfer or certified cheque.

Sincerely,

Guido the Elf,
Collections Department
Santa's Village
