Attention:  <%= name.capitalize %>'s Parents,

Re: Christmas Toy Invoice

Below are the charges for <%= name.capitalize %>'s Christmas toy order. The cost for each toy is a percentage of your home's estimated value. The cost includes delivery fee, service fee and the North Pole transportation tax. HST is separate.

=================
<%= name.capitalize %>'s Toy Order
=================
<% if behavior == "nice" %>
<% toys.each do |toy| %>

$<%= house_value/100 %>  <%= toy %>
  <% if toy == "Kaleidoscope" %>
  $0  Kaleidoscope (out of stock)
  <% end %>
<% end %>
----
$<%= subtotal = (house_value/100) * toys.count %>  Subtotal
$<%= hst = subtotal * 13 %>   HST
====
$<%= total = subtotal + hst %>  Total
<%else%>

$<%= house_value/100 %> 1 defective toy
----
$<%= subtotal = (house_value/100)%>  Subtotal
$<%= hst = subtotal * 13 %>   HST
====
$<%= total = subtotal + hst %>  Total
<% end %>


Your total comes to $<%= total %>. Payment is due upon receipt of invoice. Should you fail to submit prompt payment we will repossess all toys in this order by January 7.  I encourage you to imagine the tantrum that will ensue should all of <%= name.capitalize %>'s toys suddenly disappear.

Due to a high number of NSF incidents we no longer accept personal cheques. Please make all payments through PayPal, Interac e-transfer or certified cheque.

Sincerely,

Guido the Elf,
Collections Department
Santa's Village
